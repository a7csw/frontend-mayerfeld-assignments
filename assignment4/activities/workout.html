            <h2>My Fitness Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Staying physically fit is not just about looking good - it's about feeling strong, maintaining discipline, and building the mental resilience that carries over into every aspect of life. My weekly workout routine centers around <strong>calisthenics training</strong> and <strong>armwrestling practice</strong>, both of which have become integral parts of my identity.</p>
            
            <p>I believe in the power of bodyweight exercises and functional strength. Calisthenics teaches you to master your own body weight, building not just muscle but also coordination, flexibility, and control. Combined with armwrestling, which demands explosive power and technique, my training regimen keeps me challenged and motivated.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love This Routine</h2>
            <p>What I love most about my fitness routine is its simplicity and effectiveness. No fancy equipment needed - just me, my body, and the determination to push my limits. Calisthenics has taught me that strength comes from consistency, not complexity.</p>
            
            <p>Armwrestling adds an element of competition and technical skill that keeps things exciting. It's not just about raw strength - it's about technique, timing, and mental focus. These skills translate beyond the table into everyday confidence and problem-solving abilities.</p>
            
            <p>Every workout is a reminder that discipline in one area of life creates discipline in all areas. The mental toughness I build during a challenging set of pull-ups carries over into my studies, my relationships, and my personal projects.</p>
