    <h1>Weekly Workout & Calisthenics Training</h1>
    <p>Building strength, discipline, and resilience through bodyweight training</p>
    
    <h2>My Fitness Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Staying physically fit is not just about looking good - it's about feeling strong, maintaining discipline, and building the mental resilience that carries over into every aspect of life. My weekly workout routine centers around <strong>calisthenics training</strong> and <strong>armwrestling practice</strong>, both of which have become integral parts of my identity.</p>
    
    <p>I believe in the power of bodyweight exercises and functional strength. Calisthenics teaches you to master your own body weight, building not just muscle but also coordination, flexibility, and control. Combined with armwrestling, which demands explosive power and technique, my training regimen keeps me challenged and motivated.</p>
    
    <h3>My Weekly Training Schedule:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monday</strong> - Upper Body Calisthenics: Pull-ups, Push-ups, Dips</li>
        <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> - Armwrestling Practice: Technique & Strength</li>
        <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> - Lower Body Power: Squats, Lunges, Pistols</li>
        <li><strong>Thursday</strong> - Core & Flexibility: Planks, L-sits, Stretching</li>
        <li><strong>Friday</strong> - Full Body Circuit: Burpees, Mountain climbers</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend</strong> - Active Recovery: Light cardio, mobility work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why I Love This Routine:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Builds Functional Strength:</strong> Every exercise translates to real-world movement patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Develops Mental Toughness:</strong> Pushing through challenging workouts builds character</li>
        <li><strong>Improves Focus:</strong> Physical training enhances my ability to concentrate on studies</li>
        <li><strong>Stress Relief:</strong> Exercise is my go-to method for managing academic pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent Progress:</strong> Weekly routine ensures steady improvement and habit formation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Armwrestling Connection</h2>
    <p>Armwrestling has taught me that strength isn't just about size - it's about technique, leverage, and mental strategy. The sport demands explosive power, grip strength, and the ability to adapt tactics mid-match. These skills have made me more strategic in my approach to both fitness and life challenges.</p>
